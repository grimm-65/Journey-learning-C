// Using threads a function can run as its own thread and runs independently from the rest of the code
// Best practice to use local variables
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h> //pthread_ family of functions are prototyped

// to build -lpthread

// Create new thread
// int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine)(void *), void *arg);

// First arg is the address of a pthread_t value it references the thread in other pthread_family functions

// 2nd arg  sets various thread attributes. This value is NULL most of the time.

// 3rd arg name of the function to launch as another thread {must use void args for flexibility}

// 4th arg consists of any arguments passed to the function, or NULL for none.

// The function that runs the thread has this prototype
// void *(*start_routine)(void *)

// This format identifies the function thatâ€™s launched into its own thread, running independently of the rest of the code

// SAMPLE EXAMPLE

// Below code prompts you for youre name and also launches the thread_funct()
// function as a separate thread
// thread_funct() outputs asterisks every second
